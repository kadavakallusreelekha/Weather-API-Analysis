# Weather-API-Analysis
A data analytics project that uses a Weather API as a data source and visualizes real-time weather data entirely in Power BI. The project includes data transformation using Power Query, calculated measures using DAX, and interactive dashboards to analyze city-wise and day-wise temperature trends and weather conditions.
# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to analyze and visualize real-time weather data using a Weather API. The dashboard provides insights into city-wise and day-wise weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and weather description through interactive visuals.

The entire project is built **only using Power BI**, including data extraction, transformation, modeling, and visualization.
